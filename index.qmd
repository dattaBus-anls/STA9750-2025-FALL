## 🧭 STA 9750 – Basic Software Tools for Data Analysis (Fall 2025)

**Instructor:** Prof. Michael Weylandt  
**Format:** Flipped-classroom + experiential learning using R, Quarto, and GitHub

STA 9750 introduces graduate students to data analytics in R through a project-driven format. 
Instead of traditional exams, students complete a sequence of GitHub-hosted mini-projects and a final capstone project that mirror real-world analytical workflows. Across the semester, assignments emphasize reproducible research, data wrangling, visualization, and clear analytical storytelling using Quarto and GitHub-based collaboration.

### 📊 Mini-Projects (MP00 – MP04)

- **MP00 – Course Setup:** Git/GitHub + Quarto site  
- **MP01 – Netflix Top 10 Analysis:** data wrangling, visualization, and press-style reporting — [Open MP01](mp01.html)  
- **MP02 – Housing Affordability Index:** ACS + BLS + building permits; index construction and policy visualization — [Open MP02](mp02.html)  
- **MP03 – NYC Tree Canopy Analysis:** geospatial joins, spatial aggregation, and thematic maps — [Open MP03](mp03.html)  
- **MP04 – Just the Fact(-Check)s, Ma’am!:** employment revisions and statistical fact-checking — [Open MP04](mp04.html)

Each mini-project includes a GitHub-based peer review cycle focused on code clarity, reproducibility, and rubric-based feedback.

### 🌃 Final Project — Nightlife Analytics (NYC)

**Research Question:**  
How does nightlife activity shape urban mobility and safety, and how did COVID-19 change night-time travel behavior in New York City?

This final project examines New York City night-time mobility (8 PM–4 AM) by integrating TLC Yellow Taxi and FHV (Uber/Lyft) trip data with Yelp nightlife venue information.  
The analysis compares **pre-COVID (2019)**, **COVID (2020)**, and **post-COVID (2023)** periods to assess how nightlife-dense and non-nightlife zones experienced uneven collapse and recovery in night-time travel.

The project emphasizes reproducible workflows, zone-level aggregation using DuckDB, and data visualization to support clear interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns in urban night-time activity.
