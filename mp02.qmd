_Working page for MP #02._

This project analyzes **housing affordability and YIMBY policy trends** using:
- U.S. Census ACS data (income, rent, population)
- BLS QCEW employment and wage data
- Building permit statistics  
  
Youâ€™ll merge these datasets, construct **rent-burden and housing-growth indices**, and prepare a **policy brief** showing how permissive zoning affects affordability.
